[/] Figured out some lore
[/] Change item req's to take a list and AND them
[/] some buildings and houses


Big question: How do houses and shops work? I'd really prefer NOT to set up a shitload of tiny house interiors
Also it feels tedious to do simple things like buy and sell items.
Maybe interacting with the door is the shop, a la final fantasy 1 (and diablo, functionally)

grid of my items, their items. Click-hold to buy, selling destroys item for money.
