[x] World map, figure out some lore and shit
    - Really like the idea of a ghoulish rotting "death" rather than a fire and brimstone "demon"
    - More "Arthas" and the Reaper than Satan or Diablo
    - Or maybe there's a bunch of sin kings like in that one lore
        - Poison, Rot, Hot Metal, Radiant, Flesh (some fun themes I guess)
    
    - That one game by KittyHorrorShow, "Monastery" was fucking great. That, but with some combat in between things
        - Small, only a few rooms or spaces, several key items leading progressing with LOTS of text messages and eery atmo
        
    - Continuous world map? Tried out height maps and it felt weird and wrong
    - Maybe kind of like neverwinter nights but stitched together?

[x] Hitch when hitting interact and it not casting
[x] Blood spawning on hit, staying around on ground, placeable item (interact with flask to pick up?)
