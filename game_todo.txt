[x] Falling damage? Not sure if that's needed

[x] Fog is bugged?

[x] Multiple characters a la F&H
    - Nudity allowed (like old CRPGs tended to do) because it's so pixelly

[x] Rework background to be generic overcast clouds, and figure out fading shader tech to key off of fog color so it's always seamless
[x] Cache fog when changing levels and then restore it so fog volumes don't have to be quite so manually placed

[x] World map
    - More walls for outdoor maps
        - Stone brick walls
        - Manually placeable ramps for the above two
    - gravestones
    - more houses
    - How to do different ground textures?
